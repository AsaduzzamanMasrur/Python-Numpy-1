NumPy Exercises

Import NumPy as np

Create an array of 10 zeros

Create an array of 10 ones

Create an array of 10 fives

Create an array of the integers from 10 to 50

Create an array of all the even integers from 10 to 50

Create a 3x3 matrix with values ranging from 0 to 8

Create a 3x3 identity matrix

Use NumPy to generate a random number between 0 and 1

Random Integers

Select a int number from -10 to 10

make a 5 by 5 matrix with numbers from -10 to 10

Use NumPy to generate an array of 30 random numbers sampled from a standard normal distribution

Create the following matrix:
numbers ranging from 0.01 to 1 , a total of 100 numbers and the matrix size of 10 by 10

Create an array of 10 linearly spaced points between 0 and 1:

In the following code, what do you think a predefined value is?

Numpy Indexing and Selection

Lets make a matrix and try to select different rows and columns from it

select all rows from 3rd row and the second column

when you need any specific number in matrix you can use this particular code

Take number 20 from the mat matrix

select all the rows till row number 4 in the 2nd column

finish this the upper code understanding before today (10) november morning need to finish the whole code untill night

Select the entire 5th row

Select all the columns between 4th row and the 5th row

Now Lets do some operations

Get the sum of all the values in mat
What is the sum of all the elements in the matrix mat ?

Get the standard deviation of the values in mat

Get the sum of all the columns in mat

axis 0 = row and 1 = coloum

Get the sum of all the rows in mat

Lets convert lists into a vector

Lets make a function that does stuff we want with our matrix

Make a matrix generator function

Lets make a function thats selects portion of a matrix and generate a matrix from it

...oops we were hoping to get the original matrix but it got cut off, something wrong with the function............ How can we select the entire matrix with this function then?

Write a function that converts every row in a matrix into a list and then inputs the list into a dictionary and returns it

OK OK , IS this right do you think???????? If Not why?

... OK LSBU Elite.... Here is a challenge for you

How would you change the code to have the program to return a dictionary of columns?

HINT: Think Linear Algebra

Numpy and Time Series

OK , Cool lets now generate a Time series date columsn with Numpy

How many days are between these to dates?
